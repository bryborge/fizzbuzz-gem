# TestUnit Tests

This section is purely to appease curiosity.
I've always only ever used RSpec.
How can I call myself a Rubyist if I haven't played around with TestUnit (which literally ships with Ruby)?!

The tests defined here are exactly the same as the tests defined as RSpec specs.

## How to Run

These tests can be run from the root directory of this project with:

```sh
ruby ./spec/test_unit/fizzbuzz_test.rb
```

Output should look something like this:

```sh
Started
......
Finished in 0.0014235 seconds.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
